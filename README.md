# Python-Challenge

VOTING ANALYSIS:
The provided Python code is designed to analyze election data from a CSV file and calculate several key statistics. To begin, I imported the necessary libraries, such as os for file path operations and csv for handling CSV files. I then defined the file path to the CSV data and initialized variables to store the results of the analysis. These variables include totalVotes to count the total number of votes, candidates to hold the names of candidates who received votes, and candidateVotes as a dictionary to store the vote count for each candidate.

The code proceeds to read the CSV file using the csv.reader function within a with statement, skipping the header row. It iterates through each row of the CSV data, adding the totalVotes count for each vote cast and tracking the candidates who received votes. If a candidate is not already in the candidates list, their name is added, and their vote count is initialized in the candidateVotes dictionary. For each subsequent vote for a candidate, their vote count is updated.

To determine the winner of the election based on the popular vote, the code initializes winner and maxVotes variables. It compares the vote counts of each candidate and updates the winner if a candidate has more votes than the previous leader.

Finally, the code prints the analysis results in the specified format. This includes the total number of votes cast, the percentage of votes each candidate won, and the name of the winning candidate. 


BUDGET ANALYSIS:
The provided Python code is designed to analyze budget data from a CSV file and calculate key financial statistics. To begin, I imported the necessary libraries, such as os for file path operations and csv for handling CSV files. I then defined the file path to the CSV data and initialized variables to store the results of the analysis. These variables include totalMonths to count the total number of months, netTotal to track the net total of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, monthlyChanges to store the changes in "Profit/Losses" from month to month, and dates to store corresponding dates for these changes.

The code proceeds to read the CSV file using the csv.reader function within a with statement, skipping the header row. It iterates through each row of the CSV data, incrementing the totalMonths count for each month, and updating the netTotal with the profit or loss for that month. It also calculates and stores the monthly changes in the monthlyChanges list along with their corresponding dates in the dates list.

To calculate the average of the monthly changes, the code sums up all the changes and divides by the number of months with changes. Additionally, it identifies the greatest increase and decrease in profits and retrieves the corresponding dates.

Finally, the code prints the analysis results in the specified format. This includes the total number of months, the net total of "Profit/Losses," the average change in "Profit/Losses," and the dates and amounts of the greatest increase and decrease in profits. The formatting ensures that the results align with the expected output provided in the challenge.
